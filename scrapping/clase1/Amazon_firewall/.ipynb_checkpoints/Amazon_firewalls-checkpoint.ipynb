      "  AmazonBasics batteries are quite good in terms of capacity -- pretty much tied for the top spot compared to the other 6 brands I've tested, but other brands have the edge in capacity per dollar. When I computed value by dividing capacity by the cost per battery of the cheapest package size, they took a respectable third place, and they have the advantage of being a trusted name compared to the value leader.  In the images I have attached a graph and a table summarizing my test results for the 7 types I've tested, but if you'd like to know more about how I test ... on to the in-dept test &amp; review.\n",

      "   I've been on a bit of a quest to test all of the top-selling aaa batteries on Amazon in a repeatable, precise way. This means the same equipment, same environmental conditions, and same slots in the equipment will be used for each test. For each test, I fully discharge 3 batteries in my Opus BT-C2000 battery analyzer at rates of 100 ma, 200 ma, and 400 ma (discharge rate affects usable capacity). I have also performed this exact same test (same equipment, same conditions) on the ACDelco, Duracell Procell, Duracell Coppertop, Energizer MAX, Maxell, and Rayovac. I have linked the other brands I've reviewed at the end of this review if you'd like to take a look at the other results for comparison purposes. For the Amazon Basics batteries, the capacity at each discharge rate was:\n",

      "   <br/>\n",
      "   Note that these (and all other Alkalines) would achieve somewhat higher capacity (maybe 1200 mAh) in a low discharge application like a mouse, keyboard, remote control, etc because alkaline batteries have internal resistance that reduces usable capacity at high discharge rates.\n",
      "   <br/>\n",
      "   <br/>\n",

      "   As you can see, the Amazon batteries were very comperable ... but, at the current time the AmazonBasics batteries are $0.31/ea (36 pack), while the ACDelco batteries are about $0.21/ea (48 pack) -- so the ACDelco are significantly cheaper per mAh. I did not test shelf life, so it's possible that these may hold up better sitting in a drawer. Although both the Amazon batteries and the ACDelco batteries are certainly made on contract by a third party, I do think that I trust Amazon a bit more to provide consistent batteries than ACDelco ... although I haven't had any trouble with my ACDelco batteries so far. It's also worth noting that the Amazon batteries come in clearly superior packaging - while the ACDelco batteries come in a horrible gigantic plastic blister pack, the Amazon batteries come in a closable cardboard box. If you don't go through a lot of batteries &amp; organization of your battery drawer is important to you, that could push them into the all-around winner category despite the ~50% price premium.\n",

      "   <br/>\n",
      "   Finally, because another review specifically mentions the Rayovac AA's as being 'good' in some usage scenarios, I thought I'd share my findings for the Rayovac AAA's. In short, they're garbage - the Amazon batteries are better in EVERY case. It's possible that the Rayovac AA's are much better than the AAA's, but I think it's more likely that the version of the Rayovacs tested by the website that he got his results from is different than the most popular Rayovac on Amazon (I source all of my batteries from Amazon). I ran the Rayovac test several times because I couldn't believe how poorly they did ... here are some typical Rayovac results:\n",

       "\"\\nAmazonBasics batteries are quite good in terms of capacity -- pretty much tied for the top spot compared to the other 6 brands I've tested, but other brands have the edge in capacity per dollar. When I computed value by dividing capacity by the cost per battery of the cheapest package size, they took a respectable third place, and they have the advantage of being a trusted name compared to the value leader.  In the images I have attached a graph and a table summarizing my test results for the 7 types I've tested, but if you'd like to know more about how I test ... on to the in-dept test & review.I've been on a bit of a quest to test all of the top-selling aaa batteries on Amazon in a repeatable, precise way. This means the same equipment, same environmental conditions, and same slots in the equipment will be used for each test. For each test, I fully discharge 3 batteries in my Opus BT-C2000 battery analyzer at rates of 100 ma, 200 ma, and 400 ma (discharge rate affects usable capacity). I have also performed this exact same test (same equipment, same conditions) on the ACDelco, Duracell Procell, Duracell Coppertop, Energizer MAX, Maxell, and Rayovac. I have linked the other brands I've reviewed at the end of this review if you'd like to take a look at the other results for comparison purposes. For the Amazon Basics batteries, the capacity at each discharge rate was:Disch Rt | Capacity  | Runtime  | Sample use case100 mA | 997 mAh  | 10 hrs  |  Low-power LED flashlight200 mA | 914 mAh  | 4.5 hrs  |  Electronic toy / medium LED flashlight400 mA | 623 mAh  | 1.5 hrs  |  Motorized toy / bright LED flashlightNote that these (and all other Alkalines) would achieve somewhat higher capacity (maybe 1200 mAh) in a low discharge application like a mouse, keyboard, remote control, etc because alkaline batteries have internal resistance that reduces usable capacity at high discharge rates.The capacity of these batteries is among the best I've tested -- take a look at the attached data table for comparative data. For the cost (~$0.31/ea in a 36 pack right now), these are a decent but beatable value -- the power supplied per dollar spent is very good, but eclipsed by other currently available options.Comparison:These batteries do well capacity-wise, but value-wise are blown away by the currently cheapest energy/dollar battery that I've tested, the ACDelco aaa's. Their capacity results were:Disch Rt | Capacity  | Runtime100 mA | 1005 mAh  | 10 hrs200 mA | 864 mAh  | 4.3 hrs400 mA | 670 mAh  | 1.7 hrsAs you can see, the Amazon batteries were very comperable ... but, at the current time the AmazonBasics batteries are $0.31/ea (36 pack), while the ACDelco batteries are about $0.21/ea (48 pack) -- so the ACDelco are significantly cheaper per mAh. I did not test shelf life, so it's possible that these may hold up better sitting in a drawer. Although both the Amazon batteries and the ACDelco batteries are certainly made on contract by a third party, I do think that I trust Amazon a bit more to provide consistent batteries than ACDelco ... although I haven't had any trouble with my ACDelco batteries so far. It's also worth noting that the Amazon batteries come in clearly superior packaging - while the ACDelco batteries come in a horrible gigantic plastic blister pack, the Amazon batteries come in a closable cardboard box. If you don't go through a lot of batteries & organization of your battery drawer is important to you, that could push them into the all-around winner category despite the ~50% price premium.Finally, because another review specifically mentions the Rayovac AA's as being 'good' in some usage scenarios, I thought I'd share my findings for the Rayovac AAA's. In short, they're garbage - the Amazon batteries are better in EVERY case. It's possible that the Rayovac AA's are much better than the AAA's, but I think it's more likely that the version of the Rayovacs tested by the website that he got his results from is different than the most popular Rayovac on Amazon (I source all of my batteries from Amazon). I ran the Rayovac test several times because I couldn't believe how poorly they did ... here are some typical Rayovac results:Disch Rt | Capacity | Runtime100 mA | 908 mAh  | 9 hrs200 mA | 590 mAh  | 2.9 hrs400 mA | 443 mAh  | 1.1 hrsMy other battery tests/reviews:I have posted reviews for Duracell Coppertop, Duracell Procell and ACDelco aaa alkaline batteries with capacity data gathered using the exact same method and equipment. To find those reviews for comparison purposes, go to the product pages linked below and search for 'mah' under 'all reviews' (or just browse to them on my profile).

       " \"Speaking from practical experience of using these batteries,  these batteries are great.  These are much more reliable than some of the other reputed brands.  The primary concern was on longevity of these batteries and that is something which is difficult to compromise on.  So in my experience have found them to last about 90% of other more reputed brands.  That's not bad considering the price gap between the two.The construction looks good and eventually these batteries can be disposed off after their life is over. The pins and connectors are all good, no problems whatsoever.And of course great value for money as these aren't very expensive.Overall happy with the purchase.\",\n",
       " 'I was skeptical but figured they couldn\\'t be any worse than was I was buying at Lowes.  I got fed up when the price of a triple-A battery got up to a dollar each.  I thought that even if these didn\\'t last any longer at least they were a lot cheaper.  I use these in an LED headlamp band that I wear every evening when I check my barns at bedtime.  So, same use, same amount of time by actual count, in comparing these to both the Eveready and Duracell batteries that I had been buying.  To my very great surprise, these batteries actually last THREE times as many days as either of the \"name\" brand.  I\\'m convinced, and will be buying these from now on.  Excellent value for the money, and you won\\'t see many reviews from me that enthusiastic.',\n",
       " \"I don't do experiments with batteries to see which ones are more powerful or last longer. I've been using these AA cells, and their AAA cousins, for quite a while and I thought I'd just say I think these are as good as any other for basic household uses like remote controls, small flashlights or electric toothbrushes. And they're a good value for multi-packs so that you almost always have some around when you need them. At some point everything will probably be USB rechargeable; until then I'll keep buying these batteries.\",\n",
       " 'Thank you to Amazon for getting these batteries shipped out to South Florida after Hurricane Ian. My friend shared them with neighbors and they are still going strong! Very reasonably prices and a quality product!',\n",
       " 'They do what theyâre supposed to- they power things. Bluetooth mouse, toys, other toysâ¦they do as AA batteries should. Seem to work as well and as long as any other, though I havenât directly compared.',\n",
       " 'Batteries are great value for the price. Good for all the kids toys and noise makers. Packaging is easy to store and convenient for access when needed. Batteries are made from good materials and have a clean appeal. Power it up!',\n",
       " 'Several sites on Youtube did comparison of Amazon, Energizer, Duracell, and the cheap brand.  Amazon for the price was the top choice.  It lived as long as either the Energizer or Duracell and those two are so expensive for just a few.  Amazon then has always been my first choice, for the price and reliability long term.',\n",
       " \"Now, you can spend quite a bit on batteries that promise huge lifespans or you can be a little more parsimonious and get a lot of batteries that may not last quite as long but come close enough.And this is where these come in. Cheap to buy but last well. Not up there with the brand leaders but given the price differential considerably better value per minute of use.To be honest, the only reason to spend more money than these ones cost is because you don't have any space at all such as mountain climbing in the dark using a head torch. Other than that, these are a no brainer purchase.\",\n",
       " 'These are good alkaline AAA batteries that alas, arrive rather over extravagantly boxed!Whilst there are cheaper AAA alkaline batteries available on Amazon, these seem as good as any of the high street brands, with a good shelf and working life.Amazon quick delivery was, as always, appreciated.',\n",

This text file contains the instructions in a specific format (see examples below). Robots that choose to follow the instructions try to fetch this file and read the instructions before fetching any other file from the website. If this file doesn't exist, web robots assume that the website owner does not wish to place any limitations on crawling the entire site.\n",
